# TowerDefence

Unity microgame was created along the Udemy course "How To Create 2D Defender Game With Unity & C#" which I **CAN'T** recommend to anyone. 

Seriously, never buy this course.

The game code is a mix of what was told in the course and what I've learned elsewhere.
Unfortunately, the source of the assets is unknown, so I can't give a credit to the author(s) - the assets were provided by the course.
Maybe someone finds this repo useful.
